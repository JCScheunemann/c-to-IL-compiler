(* 
as in BNF we have production rules with terminal and non-terminal symbols 
terminal symbols begin with a lowercase letter or are enclosed in double quotes
non-terminal symbols begin with an uppercase letter

(* the non terminal S is the grammar starting point *)
(* the \ just means that what comes afterwards will be capitalized *)

the caret ^ symbol means that
the string generated by non-terminating symbol Pre1 
and the string generated by non-terminating symbol Pre2
will be glued together and not separated by a space
